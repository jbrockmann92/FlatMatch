# FlatMatch
Collaborative Project for [devCodeCamp](https://devcodecamp.com) that matches leaseholders and renters.

#### Features
* Renters and Owners will have a profile with:
  * Picture
  * About Me
  * Social Media
* Renters able to choose a preference for potential roommates
* Prospective renters able to see a list of properties where the leaseholder matches as many preferences as possible


The feature that shows all locations of interest around a given property requires a plugin at the moment for Google Chrome called Moesif: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-orign-cors-changer/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc?hl=en-US
